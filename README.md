Jewell leverages the power of ES6 Proxy to provide syntax sugar, allowing you to write cleaner code.

The best way to showcase Jewell is through code samples:

```javascript
import {jewellPrototype} from 'jewell';
jewellPrototype(Array);

const diamonds = [...];

// Get price: [2k, 100k, 300k]
diamonds.map.price; // ðŸ’Ž
diamonds.map(diamond => diamond.price); // Traditional

// Buy all pink diamonds
diamonds.filter.pink.forEach.buy(); // ðŸ’Ž
diamonds.filter(diamond => diamond.pink).forEach(diamond => diamond.buy()); // Traditional
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install jewell --save
```

And to import:

```javascript
import jewell, {jewellPrototype} from 'jewell';
```

*Note*: You may need an ES6 `Proxy` polyfill to support older browsers.

### API

- `jewell(object: object, propertyName: string)`: Proxies function property. Bear in mind the property must already exist.
- `jewellPrototype(class: object, except: string[])`: Proxies all functions with *zero or one argument* in a class prototype.  
- `._fn`: After proxying, the original method can be accessed through `._fn`.

**âš  Warning**: Be aware that `jewell(...)` and `jewellPrototype(...)` replace the original methods with proxies.
This package was created for experimental purposes, but if you decide to use it in production, make sure you're not creating unintendend behaviors or performance issues.

### Jewelling an instance property

This means only a single instance will be jewelled.

```javascript
const object = [{name: 'John'}, {name: 'Jane'}];
jewell(object, 'map');
```

### Jewelling a prototype property

This means all instances of a class will the property jewelled.

```javascript
jewell(Array.prototype, 'map');
```

### Jewelling a class

```javascript
jewellPrototype(Array, ['shift']); // Proxy functions with one or zero args except 'shift
```

## Examples

The examples below expect `jewellPrototype(Array)` to have been called.

### Mapping attributes

```javascript
const fruits = [{name: 'Apple'}, {name: 'Grape'}];
fruits.map.name; // ['Apple', 'Grape']
```

Equivalent to `fruits.map(fruit => fruit.name)`.

### Mapping the results of functions

```javascript
const photos = [...];
photos.map.crop(0, 0, 50, 50);
```

Equivalent to `photos.map(photo => photo.crop(0, 0, 50, 50))`

### Calling function for each array item

```javascript
const diamonds = [...];
diamonds.forEach.sell();
```

Equivalent to `diamonds.forEach(diamond => diamond.sell())` 

### Calling function with argument for each array item

```javascript
const kittens = [...];
kittens.forEach.feed('fish', 3);
```
Equivalent to `kittens.forEach(kitten => kitten.feed('fish', 3))`

### Filtering items

```javascript
const employees = [...];
employees.filter.retired;
```

### Filtering items with argument

```javascript
const employees = [...];
employees.filter.compliesTo('rule');
```

Equivalent to `employees.filter(employee => employee.compliesTo('rule'))`

### Filtering and mapping

```javascript
const animals = [...];
animals.filter.friendly.map.name;
```

Equivalent to `animals.filter(animal => animal.friendly).map(animal => animal.name)` 

### Checking if all items comply to a rule

```javascript
const employees = [...];
employees.every.retired; // true or false
```

Equivalent to `employees.every(employee => employee.retired)`

### Accessing the original method

```javascript
jewell(array, 'shift');
array.shift._fn // Original method
```

## Motivation

Jewell is inspired by [@franzliedke's implementation](https://laravel-news.com/higher-order-messaging)
of higher-order messaging for [Laravel](http://laravel.com)
and by [Nat Pryce's article](http://natpryce.com/articles/000535.html)
on higher-order messaging with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

Ultimately it would be very nice to have higher-order messaging implemented as a native Javascript feature,
but until then, there's Jewell.
